    "The DoIT Help Desk, where I as a part time student employee, collects availability and a desired range of hours from its student employees every semester. Currently, it is 1-2 people's job to look at this availabiliity, as well as the shifts that need to be filled and manually create a schedule for the semester. There are many different types of roles needed throughout the day that require different levels of training, and the availability of students varies widely. It takes a lot of work hours to create a schedule for the semester, and it is always subject to change as new people get hired or absences due to sickness come up.\n",

    "For this project, I would like to develop and solve an optimization problem formated such that availability and desired hours can be plugged in, and a schedule (or multiple options) can be outputed automatically to help improve the current process used by the help desk."

As an employee at the help desk, I have access to this data already from the admin portal on \"ACME\" the tool used for scheduling by the DoIT Help Desk. Additionally I will need the training level of each agent to know who can fill each type of shift. This information is also available through the same portal."

    "The optimizationn problem underlying this project is a scheduling problem, which is a special type of Linear Program. This problem will be far more complicated than those worked on in homework assignments, as the shifts to fill have different requirements based on agent training levels. Furthermore, students are able to indicate preference to working most of their shifts in either the morning, midday, or evening. I would like to be able to accommodate these preferences, possibly through a regularization term in the objective. I will also want to ensure that each agent gets a relatively even amount of hours."
